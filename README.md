# Fruit-Recognition
This project is an implementation of a fruit recognition system in MATLAB. An input image is given to the program and it is classified as an Apple, Banana, Guava or Strawberry based on the Minimum Distance Criterion of the image with a developed dataset. The HSV colour space was used to get the average values of several statistical properites from the Hue and Saturation channels, while the Value channel was used to construct the texture map using GLCM.

## Running the Project
